/**
 * An implementation of {@link @veramo/did-manager#AbstractDIDStore | AbstractDIDStore} that uses a JSON object to
 * store the relationships between DIDs, their providers and controllers and their keys and services as they are known
 * and managed by a Veramo agent.
 *
 * An instance of this class can be used by {@link @veramo/did-manager#DIDManager} as the data storage layer.
 *
 * This class must be initialized with a {@link VeramoJsonStore}, which serves as the JSON object storing data in
 * memory as well as providing an update notification callback to persist this data.
 * For correct usage, this MUST use the same {@link VeramoJsonStore} instance as the one used by
 * {@link @veramo/key-manager#KeyManager | KeyManager}.
 *
 * @beta This API may change without a BREAKING CHANGE notice.
